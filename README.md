# Arithmetic Formatter

Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:

      235
    +  52
    -----
      287

This project formats simple arithmetic calculations to make them easier to visualize. It can process multiple additions and/or subtractions simultaneously. An example run would display the following: 

    Input: 
    32 + 698, 3801 - 2, 45 + 43, 123 + 49
    
    Output:
      32         1      9999      523
    +  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
    ----    ------    ------    -----
      40     -3800     19998      474
